- ðŸ‘‹ Aloha, Iâ€™m @Bhaun808, the creator of The Antibody Academy.
  Welcome to this repository!

The Antibody Academy:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for The Antibody Academy!
This initiative aims to improve antibody discovery, development, and engineering. 
Specifically tailored to the unique challenges of immunogenetics and antibody immune receptor repertoire analysis. 
Our work primarily focuses on building pipelines and bioinformatics platforms to advance the study and practical application of antibodies.
Overview:
This repository currently contains a collection of scripts, tools, workflows, and documentation to support research in:
â€¢	Immunogenetics Analysis: Building efficient pipelines to analyze large-scale datasets, including next-generation sequencing data, single-cell sequencing, and transcriptomics.
â€¢	Bioinformatics Platforms: Developing computational tools and integrating different software to analyze immune repertoires, such as V(D)J sequencing to uncover antibody diversity and clonal lineages.
â€¢	Machine Learning for Antibody Engineering: Leveraging AI models to predict pairing of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, minimizing the reliance on expensive paired sequencing.
This repository represents an ongoing effort to establish Hawaii as a hub for advanced antibody research, contributing both locally and globally to immunological discoveries and medical advancements.

We are just getting started, and we have big ambitions for the future. Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to fork, star, or contribute to this initiative!
